    "The Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) is a non-parametric, probabilistic model used in machine learning for classification tasks. It operates by assuming that data points in feature space have an underlying function, where any finite collection of points follows a joint Gaussian distribution. This approach allows GPC to quantify uncertainty in predictions by estimating a distribution over possible functions that could fit the training data, rather than a single fixed decision boundary. GPC leverages kernel functions to measure similarity between points, enabling it to model complex, non-linear relationships in the data. During prediction, GPC provides not only a class label but also an estimate of confidence by calculating the posterior probability for each class. While powerful, GPCs are computationally intensive and scale poorly with large datasets due to the inversion of large covariance matrices, which is a key limitation of the method."

Unlike standard gradient boosting, XGBoost introduces several innovations, such as regularization (to prevent overfitting), efficient handling of missing values, and a clever usage of hardware resources, which enables parallel processing and improved computational efficiency.
